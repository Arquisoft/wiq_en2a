.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.

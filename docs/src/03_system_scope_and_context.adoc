.Explanation of the Diagram


The application will be deployed on an Azure Server. It will consist of the following:

The client communicates with the web app, the front-end of the application. Developed with *React* and *JavaScript*, this application retrieves information from the server, interacting with the *Gateway*.

We employ a facade pattern on the server, with a dedicated *Gateway service* redirecting requests to different internal services.

The services include:

- *Authentication Service*
- *Users Service*
- *Question Generator Service*
- *Game Service*
- *Groups Service*

All these services interact with the *MongoDB* database, retrieving and adding information.

To generate questions automatically, communication with the *WikiData API* is necessary. The *Question Generator Service* houses an algorithm for question generation.

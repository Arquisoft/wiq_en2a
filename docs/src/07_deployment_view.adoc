Motivation::

The sytem is divided in different service related to distinct functionalities. MongoDB used as the database to manage user's data. A service dedicated to user functionalities. Another for the graphic user interface. And a last service in charge of making request to the api of Wikidata.

Quality and/or Performance Features::

The reasons for using a microservice infratructure are the failure isolation, if one of the service fails, is not necesary that the whole system goes down, the member teams can work on different microservices simultaneously and also each microservice can be written in a different programing language better suit for the task.

When performing a the load test for the login and single player game with 1000 users conecting over a minute, we found that less than a 5% of the response end in a KO. This KO are due to the creation and start of the game.

When we create the game we also create all the questions with wikidata query service. 
To solve this problem we could look for more optimiced queries or change when the questions are created, once a day we could create a bunch of questions and sav e them in the database, with this approach, when creating a new game the questions would be selected from our local database.
